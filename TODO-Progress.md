# View Progress Feature - Implementation Plan

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
Transform the View Progress card from basic workout history to a comprehensive progress dashboard focused on strength gains, volume tracking, and consistency metrics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority Order
1. **Strength Gains** (Top Sets) - Most Important
2. **Volume Tracking** - Secondary 
3. **Consistency** - Third
4. **Recent Achievements/PRs** - Motivational
5. **WHOOP Integration** - Placeholder for future

- [x] Add volume drill-down modal

### Phase 5: Consistency Section âœ…
- [x] Create `ConsistencySection.tsx` component  
- [x] Build workout frequency calendar visualization
- [x] Implement streak tracking (current + longest streak)
- [x] Add 3x/week target tracking with progress indicators
- [x] Create consistency score calculations
- [x] Build consistency trends over time

### Phase 6: Personal Records System âœ…
- [x] Create `PersonalRecordsSection.tsx` component
- [x] Implement PR detection logic (weight + volume PRs)
- [x] Build recent achievements timeline
- [x] Add PR milestone celebrations/notifications
- [x] Create PR history tracking

### Phase 7: Recent Achievements Dashboard âœ…
- [x] Create `RecentAchievements.tsx` summary component
- [x] Build "This Month's Progress" summary cards
- [x] Add recent PRs highlight section  
- [x] Implement motivational progress indicators
- [x] Create achievement badges/icons

### Phase 8: WHOOP Integration Placeholder âœ…

- [x] Implement heart rate zones placeholder
- [x] Create performance correlation placeholder charts
- [x] Add integration status indicator

### Phase 9: Drill-Down Modals âš¡
- [x] Create `StrengthAnalysisModal.tsx` for detailed strength metrics
- [x] Build `VolumeAnalysisModal.tsx` for deep volume analysis  
- [ ] Implement `ConsistencyAnalysisModal.tsx` for consistency details
- [ ] Add `PRHistoryModal.tsx` for full PR timeline
- [ ] Create modal state management and navigation

### Phase 10: UI/UX Polish & Testing
- [ ] Add loading states for all progress sections
- [ ] Implement error handling and empty states
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Create smooth transitions and animations
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements
- [ ] Write unit tests for progress calculations
- [ ] Add integration tests for dashboard components

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Data Structure Utilization
- Leverage `sessionExercises` table for workout data
- Use `exerciseLinks` and `masterExercises` for exercise consolidation
- Utilize `workoutSessions` for consistency tracking
- Access `userPreferences.min_days_per_week` for consistency targets

### Existing Chart Infrastructure
- Extend `WeightProgressChart.tsx` for strength progression
- Reuse `OneRMProgressChart.tsx` for 1RM estimations  
- Build new volume charts using `BaseChart` component
- Follow existing chart validation and sanitization patterns

### Time Range Implementation
- Default to monthly view
- Support weekly/yearly toggles
- Implement comparative analysis (current vs previous period)
- Handle timezone considerations for consistency tracking

### Performance Considerations
- Implement data pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed progress calculations
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Consistency
- Follow existing component patterns and styling
- Use consistent color schemes from chart config
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Apply existing theme system (light/dark modes)
- Follow accessibility standards

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all calculation functions
- Integration tests for tRPC endpoints
- Component testing for UI interactions
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Performance testing for data-heavy operations
