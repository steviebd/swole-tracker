# Security Review Summary - 2025-07-28

## Executive Summary

This security review was conducted on a Next.js (T3 Stack) workout tracking application deployed on Vercel with Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Clerk authentication. The application is live and currently restricts access to authenticated users only.

**Overall Security Posture**: The application follows many modern security best practices with proper authentication and basic authorization checks. However, several critical areas require immediate attention, particularly around rate limiting and some edge cases in authorization logic.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ **Strong Foundation**
- **Observation:** Clerk integration properly implemented with middleware protection
- **Description:** Authentication is handled securely through Clerk middleware protecting all sensitive routes (`/workout`, `/templates`, `/workouts`). The tRPC context properly validates user sessions with `protectedProcedure`.
- **Impact:** Proper authentication foundation preventing unauthorized access.
- **Location:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

### ⚠️ **Authorization Logic Inconsistency**
- **Issue:** Horizontal Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
- **Description:** The `getLastExerciseData` procedure in workouts router fetches exercise data by name globally, then filters user ownership post-query rather than in the WHERE clause. This could potentially leak information about exercise names used by other users.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure about exercise naming patterns from other users' workouts.
- **Recommendation:** Modify the query to join with workout sessions and filter by user ID in the initial WHERE clause rather than post-query filtering.
- **Location:** `src/server/api/routers/workouts.ts` lines 66-77

---

## 2. Database Security

### ✅ **Proper User Scoping**
- **Observation:** Most database queries properly scope to authenticated user
- **Description:** Templates, workouts, and preferences routers consistently use `eq(table.userId, ctx.user.id)` filters ensuring users can only access their own data.
- **Impact:** Strong protection against horizontal privilege escalation.
- **Location:** All routers in `src/server/api/routers/`

### ⚠️ **Missing Row Level Security (RLS)**
- **Issue:** Database-Level Authorization Missing
- **Description:** While application-level authorization is implemented, there's no evidence of Supabase Row Level Security policies. If an attacker bypasses the application layer, direct database access could expose all user data.
- **Impact:** Complete data breach if application-level security is compromised.
- **Recommendation:** Implement RLS policies in Supabase for all tables to enforce user-scoped access at the database level as a defense-in-depth measure.
- **Location:** Database schema (`src/server/db/schema.ts`) and Supabase configuration

### ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**
- **Observation:** Drizzle ORM provides strong SQL injection protection
- **Description:** All database queries use parameterized queries through Drizzle ORM with proper type safety.
- **Impact:** Eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Location:** All database operations across routers

---

-- Enable Row Level Security on the table
ALTER TABLE public.swole-tracker_session_exercise ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for authenticated users to manage their own session exercises
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own session exercises" ON public.swole-tracker_session_exercise
FOR ALL USING (
    (select auth.uid()) = user_id
) WITH CHECK (
    (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);

## 3. Rate Limiting

### ❌ **No Rate Limiting Implemented**
- **Issue:** Denial of Service and Resource Abuse Vulnerability
- **Description:** No rate limiting middleware exists on any tRPC procedures or API routes. Attackers could abuse endpoints like workout creation, template creation, or data fetching to cause service degradation or increased billing costs.
- **Impact:** Service unavailability, increased infrastructure costs, potential for abuse of resources.
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting middleware using libraries like `@upstash/ratelimit` or `express-rate-limit` on critical endpoints (auth operations, data mutations, heavy queries).
- **Location:** `src/server/api/trpc.ts` (middleware configuration needed)

### ❌ **Authentication Endpoint Abuse**
- **Issue:** Brute Force Attack Vector
- **Description:** No protection against rapid authentication attempts or account enumeration through Clerk endpoints.
- **Impact:** Potential account takeover through brute force attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Configure Clerk rate limiting settings and implement additional application-level rate limiting for auth-related operations.
- **Location:** Clerk configuration and middleware

---

## 4. Input Validation

### ✅ **Server-Side Validation**
- **Observation:** Robust Zod schema validation on all endpoints
- **Description:** All tRPC procedures use comprehensive Zod schemas with appropriate constraints (string lengths, number validation, enum values).
- **Impact:** Strong protection against malicious input injection.
- **Location:** All routers use schemas like `exerciseInputSchema` with proper validation

### ⚠️ **Client-Side Validation Gaps**
- **Issue:** Inconsistent Client-Side Validation
- **Description:** Frontend components use basic validation (`.trim()` checks, `alert()` dialogs) but lack comprehensive input sanitization and validation patterns.
- **Impact:** Poor user experience and potential for bypassing client-side checks (though server-side validation provides protection).
- **Recommendation:** Implement consistent client-side validation using the same Zod schemas or form validation libraries for better UX.
- **Location:** `src/app/_components/template-form.tsx`, `src/app/_components/exercise-input.tsx`

### ⚠️ **File Size Limits Missing**
- **Issue:** No explicit input size limits
- **Description:** While Zod schemas enforce character limits, there are no explicit file size or request body size limits configured.
- **Impact:** Potential for large payload DoS attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Configure Next.js body size limits and implement request size validation middleware.
- **Location:** `next.config.js`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

---

## 5. Sensitive Data Handling

### ✅ **Environment Variable Security**
- **Observation:** Proper environment variable handling with T3 env
- **Description:** Sensitive data (Clerk secrets, database URLs) are properly managed through `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` with clear separation between server and client variables.
- **Impact:** Secrets are properly isolated and not exposed to client bundles.
- **Location:** `src/env.js`

### ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**
- **Observation:** No secrets found in codebase
- **Description:** Comprehensive search revealed no hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in the source code.
- **Impact:** Eliminates risk of credential exposure in repository.
- **Location:** Entire codebase reviewed

### ⚠️ **Error Message Information Disclosure**
- **Issue:** Generic Error Messages May Leak Information
- **Description:** Error messages in routers use generic strings like "Template not found" which could help attackers enumerate valid IDs or understand system structure.
- **Impact:** Minor information disclosure that could aid in reconnaissance.
- **Recommendation:** Implement more generic error messages and avoid exposing internal system details in error responses.
- **Location:** All error handling in `src/server/api/routers/`

---

## 6. Session Management

### ✅ **Clerk Session Handling**
- **Observation:** Proper session management through Clerk
- **Description:** Session management is delegated to Clerk, which provides secure session handling, token management, and session validation.
- **Impact:** Robust session security with industry best practices.
- **Location:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

---

## 7. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

### ⚠️ **Development Mode Information Leakage**
- **Issue:** Development Logging May Expose Sensitive Information
- **Description:** tRPC timing middleware logs execution times to console, which could expose information about system performance and potentially sensitive timing data in production logs.
- **Impact:** Minor information disclosure in production logs.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure development-only logging and implement proper production logging practices.
- **Location:** `src/server/api/trpc.ts` lines 87-102

### ✅ **Proper Error Formatting**
- **Observation:** Zod error formatting properly implemented
- **Description:** tRPC error formatter properly handles Zod validation errors without exposing internal system details.
- **Impact:** Good error handling without information leakage.
- **Location:** `src/server/api/trpc.ts` lines 48-57

---

## 8. Dependency Security

### ⚠️ **Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue:** esbuild Development Server Vulnerability
- **Description:** pnpm audit reveals moderate severity vulnerabilities in esbuild (<=0.24.2) that could allow websites to send requests to development server.
- **Impact:** Development environment compromise potential (production not affected).
- **Recommendation:** Update esbuild to >=0.25.0 by updating drizzle-kit dependency or adding explicit esbuild override.
- **Location:** `package.json` dependencies (drizzle-kit → esbuild)

### ✅ **Current Framework Versions**
- **Observation:** Using recent stable versions of core frameworks
- **Description:** Next.js 15.2.3, React 19.0.0, tRPC 11.0.0, and other dependencies are on recent stable versions.
- **Impact:** Reduced risk from known framework vulnerabilities.
- **Location:** `package.json`

---

## 9. Deployment Security (Vercel)

### ✅ **Environment Variable Management**
- **Observation:** Proper environment variable separation for deployment
- **Description:** Clear separation between development and production environment variables with proper Vercel deployment practices.
- **Impact:** Secure deployment configuration.
- **Location:** `.env.example`, `src/env.js`

### ⚠️ **Missing Security Headers**
- **Issue:** No Custom Security Headers Configuration
- **Description:** No evidence of custom security headers like CSP, HSTS, or X-Frame-Options in Next.js configuration.
- **Impact:** Missing additional security protections against XSS, clickjacking, and other attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Implement security headers in `next.config.js` or Vercel configuration.
- **Location:** `next.config.js`

---

### High Priority (Immediate Action Required)
1. **Implement Rate Limiting** - Critical for preventing DoS and abuse
2. **Fix Authorization Logic** - Address the `getLastExerciseData` information disclosure
3. **Configure Supabase RLS** - Add database-level security as defense-in-depth

### Medium Priority (Next Development Cycle)
1. **Update Dependencies** - Resolve esbuild vulnerability
2. **Implement Security Headers** - Add CSP and other security headers
3. **Enhance Error Handling** - Generic error messages and proper production logging

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)
1. **Client-Side Validation** - Improve UX with consistent frontend validation
2. **Request Size Limits** - Configure explicit body size limits
3. **Security Monitoring** - Implement security event monitoring and alerting

---

## Conclusion

The application demonstrates a solid security foundation with proper authentication, authorization, and data handling practices. The primary concerns are the absence of rate limiting (critical for a production application) and some edge cases in authorization logic. Implementing the high-priority recommendations will significantly strengthen the application's security posture.
