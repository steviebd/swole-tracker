# Swole Tracker Design Manifesto

## üéØ Vision Statement
Create an energetic, motivational fitness tracking experience that celebrates progress and inspires consistency through thoughtful design and engaging interactions.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Principles

### 1. Energy Through Motion
**Principle**: Every interaction should feel alive and responsive
- **Motion-first design** - Smooth transitions communicate app responsiveness
- **Purposeful animations** - Celebrations for achievements, feedback for actions
- **Progressive enhancement** - Animations enhance, never block functionality
- **Respect user preferences** - Honor reduced-motion accessibility settings

### 2. Warm Motivation Over Cold Data
**Principle**: Transform workout data into inspiring, human experiences
- **Warm color palette** - Amber/orange gradients evoke energy and warmth
- **Celebratory language** - "Personal best!" instead of just numbers
- **Visual hierarchy** - Important achievements get prominent, joyful treatment
- **Contextual encouragement** - Progress indicators that motivate next steps

### 3. Mobile-First, Touch-Optimized
**Principle**: Design for thumbs and real-world gym usage
- **Thumb-friendly targets** - 44px+ interactive elements
- **One-handed navigation** - Critical actions within thumb reach
- **Swipe gestures** - Natural interactions for charts and lists
- **High contrast** - Readable in varying lighting conditions
- **Offline-ready** - Works seamlessly without connectivity

### 4. Glass Architecture
**Principle**: Create depth and sophistication through layering
- **Surface hierarchy** - Clear relationships between interface levels  
- **Backdrop blur effects** - Modern glass aesthetics that enhance readability
- **Subtle transparency** - Layering that doesn't compromise accessibility
- **Material consistency** - Unified surface language across all components

### 5. Accessible Energy
**Principle**: High-energy design that works for everyone
- **WCAG 2.2 AA compliance** - Never compromise accessibility for aesthetics
- **High contrast ratios** - Gradients and colors meet contrast requirements
- **Clear focus indicators** - Visible navigation for keyboard users
- **Screen reader optimization** - Rich semantic markup for assistive technology

## üé® Visual Identity

### Color Psychology
- **Primary Orange (#f97316)**: Energy, enthusiasm, motivation
- **Amber Gradients**: Warmth, progress, achievement  
- **Cream Backgrounds**: Approachable, non-intimidating
- **Deep Darks**: Sophisticated, focused, premium

### Material 3 Alignment
- **Tonal palettes for every theme** ‚Äì Light, Dark, Cool, Warm, and Neutral now derive from generated Material 3 tonal palettes stored in `src/design-tokens/material3-palettes.generated.json`
- **Scriptable source of truth** ‚Äì Run `bun scripts/generate-theme-tokens.ts` to regenerate palettes when base colors shift; the generator enforces tones `0‚Äì100` and produces paired light/dark schemes
- **Semantic roles over raw hex** ‚Äì Components should consume Material 3 roles (e.g., `primaryContainer`, `surfaceVariant`, `outline`) instead of ad-hoc CSS variables for consistent accessibility
- **Mobile-first validation** ‚Äì Tonal ramps are tuned against OLED contrast requirements and gym lighting scenarios before promotion into design tokens
- **State layers & elevation overlays** ‚Äì Apply Material 3 opacity standards (4%, 8%, 12%) for hover/focus/pressed states and blend `surfaceTint` for elevation levels 1‚Äì5 to preserve depth cues in dark mode
- **One-command rebuild** ‚Äì Use `bun run tokens:build` to regenerate both JSON palettes and `src/styles/material3-tokens.css`; do this whenever palette bases or scheme rules change to keep CSS in sync

#### Palette Rationale by Theme
- **Light** ‚Äì Energised amber primaries balanced by saturated evergreen tertiary accents for cardio and streak call-outs. Neutral-variant tones lean warm to preserve depth against glass surfaces.
- **Dark** ‚Äì Copper-tinted primaries paired with aqua secondaries ensure OLED-safe contrast while keeping the brand‚Äôs heat. Tertiary purples carry success states without clashing against error red.
- **Cool** ‚Äì Indigo and teal cores for members who prefer calmer dashboards. Tonal compression is tighter to prevent glare under late-night sessions.
- **Warm** ‚Äì Earthy oranges and sand neutrals evoke sunrise training while still meeting 4.5:1 contrast at tone 40 on text pairings.
- **Neutral** ‚Äì Graphite and jade set a restrained baseline for analytics-heavy workflows; tertiary greens provide health indicators without over-saturating.

#### Mobile-First Theming Playbook
- **Contrast** ‚Äì All default role pairs (`primary`/`onPrimary`, surface tiers, containers) must pass WCAG 2.2 AA. Run `bun run test -- src/__tests__/design-tokens/material3-theme.test.ts` after editing palettes.
- **Ambient light checks** ‚Äì Validate light and warm themes on high-brightness devices; dark/cool themes on minimum brightness to avoid pure-black clipping.
- **Touch feedback** ‚Äì Interactive surfaces should reference state-layer tokens (`data-state-layer="primary"` etc.) to guarantee visible feedback on glass overlays.
- **Reduced motion** ‚Äì Components respect `useReducedMotion()`; avoid introducing motion paths that lack a reduced-motion equivalent.
- **Elevation** ‚Äì On dark/cool themes, use the generated `--md-sys-elevation-level*` properties rather than manual alpha overlays to maintain Material 3 depth cues.

### Typography Hierarchy
```
Display (Montserrat Black): Hero numbers, key achievements
Heading (Montserrat Bold): Section titles, action buttons  
Body (Open Sans Regular): Content, descriptions, labels
UI (Open Sans Medium): Interface elements, navigation
```

### Spacing & Rhythm
- **8px base unit** - Consistent spacing grid
- **1.5 line height** - Optimal readability
- **Golden ratio proportions** - Visually pleasing card dimensions
- **Generous whitespace** - Breathing room prevents cognitive overload

## üõ†Ô∏è Component Design System

### Card Hierarchy
```
1. Stat Cards (Gradient + Glass)
   - Primary metrics with celebratory styling
   - Gradient backgrounds with subtle patterns
   - Hover animations for engagement

2. Action Cards (Interactive Focus)  
   - Clear call-to-action styling
   - Icon + text combinations
   - Progressive disclosure of functionality

3. Content Cards (Readable Focus)
   - Workout lists, progress details
   - High contrast text on neutral backgrounds
   - Clear action buttons (View, Repeat)
```

### Animation Standards
- **Duration**: 200-300ms for micro-interactions, 400-600ms for page transitions
- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for natural, energetic feel
- **Transforms**: Prefer `translateY` and `scale` over position changes
- **Performance**: 60fps target, GPU-accelerated animations

### Responsive Breakpoints
```
Mobile:   320px - 768px   (Primary focus)
Tablet:   768px - 1024px  (Enhanced layouts)
Desktop:  1024px+         (Full feature set)
```

## üì± Interaction Patterns

### Touch Interactions
- **Swipe navigation** - Horizontal swipe for chart time periods
- **Pull-to-refresh** - Standard pattern for data updates  
- **Long press** - Contextual actions on workout cards
- **Tap feedback** - Visual/haptic confirmation of all actions

### Loading States
- **Skeleton screens** - Indicate content structure while loading
- **Shimmer animations** - Add energy to waiting periods
- **Progressive loading** - Show partial data immediately
- **Error recovery** - Clear messaging with retry actions

### Data Visualization
- **Progress bars** - Gradient fills showing goal completion
- **Charts with personality** - Smooth animations and hover states
- **Achievement badges** - Celebratory visual rewards
- **Trend indicators** - Clear up/down visual cues

## üéØ Content Strategy

### Voice & Tone
- **Encouraging**: "Great consistency!" vs "100% completion rate"
- **Personal**: "Welcome back, Steven!" vs "User dashboard"
- **Achievement-focused**: "Personal best!" vs "New record"
- **Action-oriented**: "Start Workout" vs "Begin Session"

### Microcopy Guidelines
