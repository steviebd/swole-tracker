# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 31st July 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Steven Duong (referred to as "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal data when you use our services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience with our service.

## 1. Data We Collect

We collect various types of information from and about you, including:

- **Personal Identification Information**: Your name and email address.
- **Technical Data**: Your IP address.
- **Usage Data**: Information about how you use our website and/or application, including access times, pages viewed, and the features you interact with.
- **Exercise and Health-Related Data**: This includes exercise data you submit directly, as well as workout and health-related data collected from third-party integrations (e.g., Whoop). This data may include, but is not limited to, activity type, duration, intensity, heart rate, recovery metrics, and sleep data.

## 2. How We Collect Your Data

We collect data through the following methods:

- **Directly from You**: When you register for our service, input exercise data, or communicate with us.
- **Through Third-Party Integrations**: When you connect third-party services (like Whoop) to our platform, we receive data from those services with your explicit consent.
- **Automatically via Website/Application Usage and Analytics**: We collect usage data and technical data through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies as you interact with our service. This helps us understand how our service is used and improve your experience.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use the collected data exclusively to:

- **Provide and Improve Our Service**: To deliver and personalise the content and features of our service to you. This includes displaying your exercise data, tracking your progress, and providing insights based on your workout information.
- **Serve Customer Content**: To process and present the exercise and workout data you and integrated third parties provide, enabling you to track, analyse, and manage your health and fitness journey.
- **Internal Analysis and Research**: To understand trends, user behaviour, and to improve the functionality and offerings of our service.
- **Communicate with You**: To send you service-related notifications, updates, and support messages.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

All data we collect is stored securely on our servers located in Australia. We implement robust security measures, including:

- **Encryption**: Your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorised access.
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls are in place to ensure that only authorised personnel can access your data, and only when necessary to perform their duties.

We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal data.

## 5. Data Sharing with Third Parties

We do not share your personal identification data (name, email address) with any third parties for their marketing or commercial purposes.

However, to provide you with enhanced analysis and insights, we may utilise Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs) provided by third-party services. When interacting with these LLMs:

- **Anonymised and De-identified Data**: We will send anonymised and de-identified exercise and health-related data to these third-party LLMs. This means that any data sent will not directly identify you. We remove or obscure information that could reasonably be used to identify you before transmission.
- **Purpose**: The sole purpose of sending this anonymised and de-identified data to LLMs is to leverage their analytical capabilities to help you improve your health through advanced analysis and personalised insights derived from your exercise data.
- **Third-Party LLM Data Retention**: Please be aware that these third-party LLM providers may store the anonymised and de-identified data sent to them for their own model training, improvement, or other purposes as outlined in their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services we integrate with (e.g., Whoop, and implicitly, the LLM providers we use) for a comprehensive understanding of their data handling practices. We select LLM providers with strong privacy and security commitments where possible.

## 6. Your Data Rights

As an Australian user, you have rights under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), including the right to:

- **Access Your Data**: Request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- **Correction**: Request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you.
- **Deletion**: Request the deletion of your personal data.

If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at [Your Contact Email Address - e.g., steven@yourdomain.com]. We will process your request within 30 days of receipt.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our service is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
