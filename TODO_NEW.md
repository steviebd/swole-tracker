# New Feature Backlog

- [ ] **Adaptive Progression Playbooks** — Generate 4–6 week progressive overload roadmaps per template, combining recent session data with 1RM/volume trends to auto-populate upcoming workouts and call out expected PR attempts.
  - Key touchpoints: `src/server/api/routers/progress.ts` (new planner endpoints), `src/app/templates` (plan editor UI), `src/lib/ai-prompts/enhanced-health-advice.ts` (extend prompt with block-level context).
- [ ] **Recovery-Guided Session Planner** — Surface a morning "train vs. recover" checklist that merges WHOOP readiness, wellness inputs, and planned workload to recommend the best template or auto-adjust intensity knobs before a workout starts.
  - Key touchpoints: `src/server/api/routers/whoop.ts` (readiness aggregation), `src/app/workout/start` (planner UI), `src/trpc/*` (mutation to persist chosen adjustments).
- [x] **AI Debrief & Goal Tracking Feed** — After each logged session, push an AI-generated debrief that highlights PRs, adherence, and next focus areas, storing snapshots so users can review streaks and coaching cues over time.
  - Implementation guide:
    1. **Model & schema**: Introduce a dedicated Drizzle table (e.g. `sessionDebriefs`) with `user_id`, `sessionId`, structured payload fields (`summary`, `prHighlights`, `adherenceScore`, `focusAreas`, `streakContext`, `overloadDigest`, `metadata` JSON), and interaction columns (`viewedAt`, `dismissedAt`, `pinnedAt`, `regenerationCount`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`). Index on `user_id + createdAt` and enforce one active snapshot per `sessionId` while allowing historical versions via `version`/`parentDebriefId`.
    2. **Runtime contracts**: Define Zod schemas & shared types under `src/server/api/schemas/health-advice-debrief.ts` and `src/server/api/types/health-advice-debrief.ts` to mirror the table shape (include optional adherence metrics when overload suggestions are missing).
    3. **Prompt pipeline**: Add a new prompt builder in `src/lib/ai-prompts/session-debrief.ts` that accepts workout metrics, overload recommendation outputs (when present), and streak context. Keep it independent of the start-of-workout advisor while gracefully degrading when overload data is absent.
    4. **Data aggregation helper**: Create a utility (e.g. `src/server/api/utils/session-debrief.ts`) that gathers session stats, PR detection (reuse progress utilities), user adherence history, health-advice suggestions, and streak calculations. Ensure it tolerates offline or missing data fallbacks.
    5. **Generation flow**: Extend `healthAdviceRouter` (or a sibling router) with mutations to `generateAndSaveDebrief`, `listBySession`, and interaction mutations (`markViewed`, `togglePinned`, `dismiss`, `regenerate`). Persist new versions instead of overwriting so streak timelines stay auditable.
    6. **Trigger point**: Hook the generation call immediately after a workout is finalized (likely the `workouts.save`/`complete` mutation). Fire-and-forget the AI call through an async job/queue helper so the UI is non-blocking; include retry + logger instrumentation.
    7. **UI/UX**: Update `src/app/workouts/[id]` with a post-session debrief panel featuring the latest snapshot, historical carousel, and controls for pin/dismiss/regenerate. Use optimistic updates and guard rails for offline mode.
    8. **Analytics**: Instrument `src/lib/analytics` with clear events such as `ai_debrief.viewed`, `ai_debrief.regenerated`, `ai_debrief.dismissed`, capturing session ID, version, and streak length. Wire front-end hooks to emit on view/regenerate interactions.
    9. **Auth guarding & access control**: Ensure all debrief queries route through protected procedures validating `ctx.user.id` and respect the new indices for pagination.
    10. **Testing & migration**: Add Vitest coverage for the prompt builder, utility aggregation edge cases, and router procedures. Generate the Drizzle migration, update `src/env.js` if a dedicated `AI_DEBRIEF_MODEL` or temperature knobs are required, and document the rollout path (DB migration + cache warms).
- [ ] **Offline Conflict Resolution Center** — Provide a dedicated screen to review queued offline actions, resolve merge conflicts, and retry failed syncs, so heavy travelers trust the offline-first story.
  - Key touchpoints: `src/lib/offline-storage.ts`, `src/lib/mobile-offline-queue.ts` (expose queue snapshots), `src/app/workouts` (new management UI).
- [ ] **Plateau & Milestone Alerts** — Detect stalled lifts, forecast time-to-PR, and trigger milestone badges with tailored next steps so lifters stay motivated and see tangible progress.
  - Key touchpoints: `src/server/api/routers/progress.ts` (plateau detection utilities), `src/providers/PostHogProvider.tsx` / `src/lib/posthog.ts` (event tracking), `src/components/notifications` (toast/banner delivery).
