# Progress Page Performance Optimization

## Overview

The `/progress/` page suffers from slow load times due to heavy historical data processing. This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize performance through data aggregation, pagination, caching improvements, and query optimization.

## Phase 1: Data Aggregation Infrastructure (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

### Database Schema Changes

- [x] Create `exercise_daily_summary` table for pre-computed daily metrics
  - Fields: user_id, exercise_name, date, total_volume, max_weight, max_one_rm, session_count
  - Primary key: (user_id, exercise_name, date)
- [x] Create `exercise_weekly_summary` table for weekly aggregates
  - Fields: user_id, exercise_name, week_start, avg_volume, max_one_rm, session_count, trend_slope
  - Primary key: (user_id, exercise_name, week_start)
- [x] Create `exercise_monthly_summary` table for monthly rollups
  - Fields: user_id, exercise_name, month_start, total_volume, max_one_rm, session_count, consistency_score
- [x] Add database migration script to create new tables
- [x] Update Drizzle schema definitions for new tables

### Aggregation Logic

- [x] Implement daily aggregation function `aggregateExerciseDaily()`
  - Process all sessions for a user/day/exercise
  - Calculate volume, max weight, max 1RM, session count
  - Use chunking for large result sets to respect D1 variable limits
- [x] Implement weekly aggregation function `aggregateExerciseWeekly()`
  - Roll up daily data into weekly summaries
  - Calculate trend slopes using linear regression
  - Use chunking for bulk weekly aggregations
- [x] Implement monthly aggregation function `aggregateExerciseMonthly()`
  - Roll up weekly data into monthly summaries
  - Calculate consistency scores
  - Use chunking for bulk monthly aggregations
- [x] Create aggregation trigger system for real-time updates
  - Hook into session creation/update/deletion
  - Maintain data consistency
  - Batch aggregation triggers to avoid overwhelming the database

## Phase 2: Query Optimization & Pagination (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

### Database Indexes

- [x] Add composite index on `session_exercises(user_id, resolved_exercise_name, workout_date)`
- [x] Add index on `session_exercises(user_id, workout_date, volume_load, one_rm_estimate)`
- [x] Add index on `workout_sessions(user_id, workout_date)`
- [ ] Analyze query execution plans for slow queries

### Pagination Implementation

- [x] Update `getStrengthProgression` to support cursor-based pagination
  - Add `cursor` and `limit` parameters
  - Return `nextCursor` in response
  - Default limit: 50 sessions
- [x] Update `getVolumeProgression` with pagination
  - Paginate by date ranges
  - Support month-by-month loading
- [x] Update `getProgressHighlights` to paginate large result sets
  - Limit PR results to 50 by default
  - Add "load more" functionality
- [x] Implement client-side pagination state management
  - Track cursors for each data section
  - Handle infinite scroll for large datasets

### Query Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Replace raw session queries with aggregated data queries
  - Use daily summaries for overview charts
  - Use weekly summaries for trend analysis
- [x] Implement query result caching at database level
  - Cache expensive calculations (trend analysis, consistency scores)
- [x] Add query result memoization for repeated requests

## Phase 3: Caching Strategy Enhancement (Medium Priority)

### TanStack Query Configuration

- [ ] Extend cache times for aggregated data queries
  - Daily summaries: 48 hours stale time
  - Weekly summaries: 9 days stale time
  - Monthly summaries: 45 days stale time
- [ ] Implement smart cache invalidation
  - Invalidate aggregated data when new sessions are added
  - Partial cache updates for incremental changes
- [ ] Add cache warming for frequently accessed data
  - Pre-load user's most common exercises
  - Cache dashboard overview data

### Background Cache Updates

- [ ] Implement cache warming service
  - Run after new workout sessions
  - Update affected aggregations
- [ ] Add cache invalidation webhooks
  - Trigger on data changes
  - Update dependent cached queries

## Phase 4: Progressive Loading & UX (Medium Priority)

### Chart Optimization

- [ ] Implement multi-resolution chart loading
  - Load weekly aggregates first (low resolution)
  - Load daily data on zoom/demand (high resolution)
- [ ] Add chart virtualization for large datasets
  - Only render visible data points
  - Progressive loading of off-screen data
- [ ] Implement chart data prefetching
  - Load adjacent time ranges in background

### Component-Level Optimizations

- [ ] Add skeleton loading states for each section
  - Progressive loading indicators
  - Show cached data while refreshing
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Session tables with 100+ rows
  - Exercise selection dropdowns
- [ ] Add data export functionality
  - Background processing for large exports
  - Progress indicators for long operations

## Phase 5: Background Processing (Low Priority)

### Calculation Offloading

- [ ] Move trend calculations to background jobs
  - Pre-compute regression analysis
  - Store results in cache/database
  - Use chunked processing for large datasets
- [ ] Implement consistency score batch processing
  - Calculate for all exercises periodically
  - Update during low-traffic hours
  - Process in chunks to respect D1 limits
- [ ] Add data archival system
  - Move old raw data to compressed storage
  - Keep only recent data in fast storage
  - Use chunked operations for bulk archival

### Scheduled Tasks

- [ ] Create daily aggregation job
  - Run nightly to update summary tables
  - Process previous day's data
- [ ] Create weekly trend analysis job
  - Update trend slopes and predictions
  - Generate performance insights
- [ ] Implement data cleanup routines
  - Remove old cached data
  - Archive historical raw sessions

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Analytics (Ongoing)

### Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Add performance tracking to all progress queries
  - Log query execution times
  - Track data transfer sizes
- [ ] Implement user experience metrics
  - Time to interactive for progress page
  - Cache hit rates
  - Error rates for slow queries
- [ ] Add database performance monitoring
  - Query execution plans
  - Index usage statistics
  - Table size monitoring

### Analytics Integration

- [ ] Track page load performance
  - Segment by data volume (light/medium/heavy users)
  - Monitor impact of optimizations
- [ ] Add user behavior analytics
  - Which sections are most used
  - Common time ranges queried
  - Cache effectiveness metrics
