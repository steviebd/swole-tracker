# TanStack Solutions Integration Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive migration plan for integrating TanStack Router, Form, Virtual, and Table into the Swole Tracker application. Each phase includes detailed tasks with checkboxes for tracking progress, followed by quality gates (test coverage ≥100%, `bun check` pass, `bun build` pass).

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (2-3 weeks)

### Package Installation & Configuration

- [ ] Install TanStack packages:
  - [ ] `@tanstack/react-router` (latest stable)
  - [ ] `@tanstack/react-form` (latest stable)
  - [ ] `@tanstack/react-virtual` (latest stable)
  - [ ] `@tanstack/react-table` (latest stable)
  - [ ] `@tanstack/router-devtools` (dev dependency)
  - [ ] `@tanstack/router-cli` (dev dependency)
- [ ] Update package.json scripts for TanStack Router CLI
- [ ] Configure TypeScript paths for new route structure
- [ ] Set up TanStack Router configuration file
- [ ] Create migration testing environment with feature flags

### Documentation & Analysis

- [ ] Document current routing patterns and file structure
- [ ] Analyze all form implementations (template-form.tsx, auth forms)
- [ ] Catalog all table implementations and their features
- [ ] Identify virtual list usage patterns
- [ ] Create compatibility matrix for React 19
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking baseline

### Development Environment

- [ ] Configure TanStack Router DevTools
- [ ] Set up hot reloading for route changes
- [ ] Create parallel build system for gradual migration
- [ ] Implement feature flag system for A/B testing

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] Test coverage: ≥95% (existing functionality)
- [ ] `bun check` passes without errors
- [ ] `bun build` completes successfully

---

## Phase 2: Phased TanStack Router Migration (4-6 weeks)

This phase has been broken down into smaller, incremental stages to de-risk the migration, address authentication patterns early, and provide a clear strategy for deprecating old Next.js files.

### Phase 2A: Core Setup & First Static Route (1 week)

**Goal:** Validate the foundational setup of TanStack Router with minimal impact.

- [ ] Create `src/routes/` directory structure
- [ ] Set up the root route (`src/routes/__root.tsx`) with layout, error boundaries, and loading states.
- [ ] Migrate one low-risk static route (e.g., `/privacy` or `/terms`).
- [ ] Update the navigation link for the migrated route to use `<Link>`.
- [ ] **File Deprecation:** Rename the corresponding Next.js page file (e.g., `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` -> `src/app/privacy/page.tsx.deprecated`).

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] The single migrated route works correctly.
- [ ] TanStack Router DevTools are operational.
- [ ] `bun check` and `bun build` pass.

---

### Phase 2B: Authentication Strategy & Guarded Routes (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Define and implement the new authentication model, replacing Next.js/tRPC patterns for route protection.

- [ ] **Auth Analysis:** Document the current session/token handling and define the new strategy for accessing session data in route loaders and actions.
- [ ] **Auth Guard:** Implement the primary authentication check in the root route's `beforeLoad` handler to protect authenticated routes.
- [ ] **Sign-In Route:** Migrate the `/sign-in` page.
- [ ] **First Guarded Route:** Migrate a simple, authenticated route (e.g., a user dashboard or settings page) to validate the auth guard.
- [ ] Update programmatic navigation and redirects related to authentication.
- [ ] **File Deprecation:** Deprecate the Next.js files for the migrated auth routes.

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected from protected routes.
- [ ] Authenticated users can access protected routes.
- [ ] Session data is correctly accessed in loaders.
- [ ] `bun check` and `bun build` pass.

---

### Phase 2C: Dynamic & Complex Route Migration (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Migrate the core dynamic and data-heavy routes of the application.

- [ ] **Dynamic Routes:** Migrate routes that use URL parameters (e.g., `/templates/[id]/edit`, `/workout/session/[id]`).
  - [ ] Implement route loaders for data fetching.
- [ ] **Complex Routes:** Migrate routes that rely on search parameters for state (e.g., filtering, sorting, pagination on `/workouts/[id]`).
  - [ ] Implement search parameter validation and handling (`.parse` and `.stringify`).
- [ ] **Nested Routes:** Migrate any remaining nested routes (e.g., `/templates/new`).
- [ ] **File Deprecation:** Deprecate the Next.js files for all migrated routes.

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Data is fetched and displayed correctly via loaders.
- [ ] Search parameter state is correctly managed.
- [ ] All tests for migrated routes pass.

---

### Phase 2D: Finalization & Cleanup (1 week)

**Goal:** Complete the transition by replacing all remaining Next.js routing artifacts and ensuring full integration.

- [ ] **Component Sweep:** Replace all remaining instances of Next.js `<Link>` and `useRouter` across the entire application (components, hooks, etc.).
- [ ] **API Route Logic:** Review and update any API route logic that performed redirects to use router-aware responses if necessary.
- [ ] **Final Validation:** Perform end-to-end testing on all major user flows.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Update the main project README and any relevant developer docs with information about the new routing system.

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] No instances of `next/link` or `next/navigation` remain in the codebase.
- [ ] All navigation, programmatic and declarative, uses TanStack Router.
- [ ] Test coverage: ≥100% (including new route tests)
- [ ] `bun check` passes without TypeScript errors
- [ ] `bun build` completes successfully

---

## Phase 3: TanStack Form Migration (2-3 weeks)

> **Status:** ✅ **PHASE 3 COMPLETED** (2025-10-30)
>
> **What Was Accomplished:**
>
> - ✅ Full migration of template-form.tsx from react-hook-form to TanStack Form
> - ✅ Created reusable TanStack Form infrastructure (`src/lib/forms/tanstack-form-config.ts`)
> - ✅ Created TanStack-compatible UI components (`src/components/ui/tanstack-form.tsx`)
> - ✅ All automated tests pass (839 tests, 0 regressions)
> - ✅ Build and type checking successful
> - ✅ Zero breaking changes, full feature parity maintained
>
> **Current State:**
>
> - ✅ @tanstack/react-form@1.23.8 installed
> - ✅ @tanstack/zod-form-adapter@0.42.1 installed
> - ✅ Zod validation integrated with TanStack Form
> - ✅ template-form.tsx **now using TanStack Form** (react-hook-form removed)
> - ✅ Backup of original implementation saved as `template-form-rhf-backup.tsx`
>
> **Note:** Auth forms (`login/page.tsx`, `register/page.tsx`) are WorkOS-managed and only serve as UI shells that redirect to WorkOS OAuth endpoints. No migration needed for these.
