## Phase 3: TanStack Form Migration (2-3 weeks)

> **Status:** ✅ **PHASE 3 COMPLETED** (2025-10-30)
>
> **What Was Accomplished:**
>
> - ✅ Full migration of template-form.tsx from react-hook-form to TanStack Form
> - ✅ Created reusable TanStack Form infrastructure (`src/lib/forms/tanstack-form-config.ts`)
> - ✅ Created TanStack-compatible UI components (`src/components/ui/tanstack-form.tsx`)
> - ✅ All automated tests pass (839 tests, 0 regressions)
> - ✅ Build and type checking successful
> - ✅ Zero breaking changes, full feature parity maintained
>
> **Current State:**
>
> - ✅ @tanstack/react-form@1.23.8 installed
> - ✅ @tanstack/zod-form-adapter@0.42.1 installed
> - ✅ Zod validation integrated with TanStack Form
> - ✅ template-form.tsx **now using TanStack Form** (react-hook-form removed)
> - ✅ Backup of original implementation saved as `template-form-rhf-backup.tsx`
>
> **Note:** Auth forms (`login/page.tsx`, `register/page.tsx`) are WorkOS-managed and only serve as UI shells that redirect to WorkOS OAuth endpoints. No migration needed for these.

### Form Infrastructure Setup

- [x] Install @tanstack/react-form and related packages (from Phase 1)
- [x] Create TanStack Form configuration utilities (`src/lib/forms/tanstack-form-config.ts`)
- [x] Set up form validation adapters for Zod (leverage existing Zod schemas)
- [x] Implement form error handling patterns
- [x] Create reusable form field components (`src/components/ui/tanstack-form.tsx`)
- [x] Set up form submission utilities (integrate with tRPC)

### Template Form Migration (High Risk - Primary Focus) ✅ COMPLETED

Current implementation: `src/app/_components/template-form.tsx` (~300 lines, **migrated to TanStack Form**)

- [x] Convert `useFieldArray` to TanStack Form field arrays
- [x] Update drag-and-drop functionality (preserve useUniversalDragReorder integration)
- [x] Migrate Zod validation schema (templateFormSchema)
- [x] Test complex form validation and submission
- [x] Validate form state persistence

### Wellness Modals Migration (Optional - Low Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

Current state: Simple useState-based forms, no react-hook-form
