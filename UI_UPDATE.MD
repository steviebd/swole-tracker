Phase 6: Advanced gestures and layout

- Multi-select sets for bulk edits
- Long-press context menu (duplicate set, clear values, set RPE/rest for all)
- True asymmetric gesture preferences per user/exercise
- Horizontal “set lanes” option for dense entry

Phase 7: Integrations and data quality

- Whoop overlay for recovery readiness hints in-session
- Master exercise library curation tools and merge/fix flows
- Data validation hardening (unit consistency, outlier detection with soft prompts)

Phase 8: Performance and platform readiness

- Virtualize long exercise lists; concurrent rendering audits
- PWA installability checks; offline shell routes; background sync tuning
- Fast path metrics: TTI, TBT, input latency dashboards (perf_metrics aggregation)

Phase 9: Security and governance

- Rate-limit tuning per route; abuse scenarios
- Audit logs for workout edits/deletes
- Privacy controls for analytics/telemetry collection

Phase 10: Launch hardening

- E2E passes for gestures, numpad, undo, predictive defaults, offline
- Feature flags and kill switches for new engines
- Migration/rollback playbooks and monitoring dashboards
