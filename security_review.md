# Security Review Summary - 2025-07-31

## Executive Summary

This security review was conducted on a Next.js (T3 Stack) workout tracking application deployed on Vercel with Supabase (PostgreSQL) and Clerk authentication. The application includes new Whoop API integration with webhook support for real-time workout updates.

**Overall Security Posture**: The application demonstrates a strong security foundation with proper authentication, comprehensive authorization, database-level security (RLS), and robust webhook security implementation. Recent improvements have addressed many previously identified vulnerabilities. Some minor issues remain around logging practices and dependency management.

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization

### ✅ **Strong Foundation**
- **Observation:** Clerk integration properly implemented with middleware protection
- **Description:** Authentication is handled securely through Clerk middleware protecting all sensitive routes (`/workout`, `/templates`, `/workouts`). The tRPC context properly validates user sessions with `protectedProcedure`.
- **Impact:** Proper authentication foundation preventing unauthorized access.
- **Location:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

### ⚠️ **Hardcoded User ID Fallback**
- **Issue:** Security Technical Debt - Hardcoded User ID
- **Description:** The Whoop router contains hardcoded fallback user ID `"user_30ZYC14ofVo8hb4x0qqVMnKglUe"` for migration purposes. This creates a maintenance burden and potential security risk if not properly cleaned up.
- **Impact:** Technical debt that could lead to confusion or unintended access patterns.
- **Recommendation:** Remove hardcoded user ID after confirming all users have been migrated to consistent user ID format.
- **Location:** `src/server/api/routers/whoop.ts` lines 83, 25

---

## 2. Database Security

### ✅ **Proper User Scoping**
- **Observation:** Most database queries properly scope to authenticated user
- **Description:** Templates, workouts, and preferences routers consistently use `eq(table.userId, ctx.user.id)` filters ensuring users can only access their own data.
- **Impact:** Strong protection against horizontal privilege escalation.
- **Location:** All routers in `src/server/api/routers/`

### ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS) Implemented**
- **Observation:** Comprehensive database-level authorization policies
- **Description:** Complete RLS policies have been implemented for all tables using Clerk user ID integration. These provide defense-in-depth security at the database level, ensuring data isolation even if application-level security is bypassed.
- **Impact:** Strong protection against data breaches through multiple security layers.
- **Location:** `src/server/db/rls.sql` - Complete RLS policy implementation

### ✅ **SQL Injection Protection**
- **Observation:** Drizzle ORM provides strong SQL injection protection
- **Description:** All database queries use parameterized queries through Drizzle ORM with proper type safety.
- **Impact:** Eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Location:** All database operations across routers

---

-- Enable Row Level Security on the table
ALTER TABLE public.swole-tracker_session_exercise ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for authenticated users to manage their own session exercises
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own session exercises" ON public.swole-tracker_session_exercise
FOR ALL USING (
    (select auth.uid()) = user_id
) WITH CHECK (
    (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);

## 3. Rate Limiting

### ✅ **Rate Limiting Implementation**
- **Observation:** Custom database-driven rate limiting system
- **Description:** A comprehensive rate limiting system has been implemented using database-backed tracking (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`). Currently deployed on the Whoop sync endpoint with configurable limits per user per endpoint.
- **Impact:** Protection against abuse of resource-intensive operations.
- **Location:** `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`, `src/app/api/whoop/sync-workouts/route.ts`

### ⚠️ **Limited Rate Limiting Coverage**
- **Issue:** Rate limiting not applied to all endpoints
- **Description:** While Whoop sync operations are rate limited, other potentially resource-intensive endpoints (template operations, bulk workout creation) do not have explicit rate limiting.
- **Impact:** Potential for abuse of unprotected endpoints.
- **Recommendation:** Extend rate limiting to other mutation endpoints and consider implementing per-endpoint rate limiting middleware.
- **Location:** Additional tRPC procedures and API routes

---

## 4. Input Validation

### ✅ **Server-Side Validation**
- **Observation:** Robust Zod schema validation on all endpoints
- **Description:** All tRPC procedures use comprehensive Zod schemas with appropriate constraints (string lengths, number validation, enum values).
- **Impact:** Strong protection against malicious input injection.
- **Location:** All routers use schemas like `exerciseInputSchema` with proper validation

### ⚠️ **Client-Side Validation Gaps**
- **Issue:** Inconsistent Client-Side Validation
- **Description:** Frontend components use basic validation (`.trim()` checks, `alert()` dialogs) but lack comprehensive input sanitization and validation patterns.
- **Impact:** Poor user experience and potential for bypassing client-side checks (though server-side validation provides protection).
- **Recommendation:** Implement consistent client-side validation using the same Zod schemas or form validation libraries for better UX.
- **Location:** `src/app/_components/template-form.tsx`, `src/app/_components/exercise-input.tsx`

### ⚠️ **File Size Limits Missing**
- **Issue:** No explicit input size limits
- **Description:** While Zod schemas enforce character limits, there are no explicit file size or request body size limits configured.
- **Impact:** Potential for large payload DoS attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Configure Next.js body size limits and implement request size validation middleware.
- **Location:** `next.config.js`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

---

## 5. Webhook Security

### ✅ **Robust Webhook Signature Verification**
- **Observation:** Industry-standard webhook security implementation
- **Description:** Whoop webhooks use HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. Timestamp validation prevents replay attacks (5-minute window).
- **Impact:** Strong protection against webhook spoofing and replay attacks.
- **Location:** `src/lib/whoop-webhook.ts`, `src/app/api/webhooks/whoop/route.ts`

### ✅ **Proper Secret Management**
- **Observation:** Webhook secrets properly managed through environment variables
- **Description:** Webhook verification uses `WHOOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from environment configuration with proper validation and error handling when secret is missing.
- **Impact:** Secure secret management for webhook verification.
- **Location:** `src/env.js`, `src/lib/whoop-webhook.ts`

### ✅ **User Authorization in Webhook Processing**
- **Observation:** Webhook processing maintains user isolation
- **Description:** Webhook processing validates user integration ownership before processing workout updates, ensuring webhooks can only affect data for users who have authorized the integration.
- **Impact:** Prevents unauthorized data modification through webhook abuse.
- **Location:** `src/app/api/webhooks/whoop/route.ts` lines 23-32

---

## 6. Sensitive Data Handling

### ✅ **Environment Variable Security**
- **Observation:** Proper environment variable handling with T3 env
- **Description:** Sensitive data (Clerk secrets, database URLs) are properly managed through `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` with clear separation between server and client variables.
- **Impact:** Secrets are properly isolated and not exposed to client bundles.
- **Location:** `src/env.js`

### ✅ **No Hardcoded Secrets**
- **Observation:** No secrets found in codebase
- **Description:** Comprehensive search revealed no hardcoded API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in the source code.
- **Impact:** Eliminates risk of credential exposure in repository.
- **Location:** Entire codebase reviewed

### ✅ **OAuth Token Security**
- **Observation:** Secure third-party API token management
- **Description:** Whoop OAuth tokens are properly stored with user scoping and include automatic refresh logic. Access tokens are scoped to specific users and operations.
- **Impact:** Secure integration with third-party APIs without token leakage.
- **Location:** `src/server/db/schema.ts` (userIntegrations table), `src/app/api/whoop/sync-workouts/route.ts`

---

## 7. Session Management

### ✅ **Clerk Session Handling**
- **Observation:** Proper session management through Clerk
- **Description:** Session management is delegated to Clerk, which provides secure session handling, token management, and session validation.
- **Impact:** Robust session security with industry best practices.
- **Location:** `src/middleware.ts`, `src/server/api/trpc.ts`

---

## 8. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

### ⚠️ **Verbose Logging in Production**
- **Issue:** Detailed logging may expose sensitive information
- **Description:** Extensive console.log and console.error statements throughout the application, including in webhook processing, API routes, and service integrations. While useful for debugging, these may expose sensitive data in production logs.
- **Impact:** Potential information disclosure through production log aggregation systems.
- **Recommendation:** Implement environment-aware logging that reduces verbosity in production, and ensure sensitive data is not logged.
- **Location:** Multiple files - webhook routes, API routes, service integrations

### ✅ **Proper Error Formatting**
- **Observation:** Zod error formatting properly implemented
- **Description:** tRPC error formatter properly handles Zod validation errors without exposing internal system details.
- **Impact:** Good error handling without information leakage.
- **Location:** `src/server/api/trpc.ts` lines 48-57

---

## 9. Dependency Security

### ⚠️ **Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue:** esbuild Development Server Vulnerability
- **Description:** pnpm audit reveals moderate severity vulnerabilities in esbuild (<=0.24.2) that could allow websites to send requests to development server.
- **Impact:** Development environment compromise potential (production not affected).
