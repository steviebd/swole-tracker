# Migration Plan: Vercel/Supabase to Cloudflare/WorkOS

This document outlines the strategy and step-by-step plan for migrating the Swole Tracker application from its current stack (Vercel, Supabase) to a new stack centered on Cloudflare (Workers, D1) and WorkOS for authentication.

## 1. High-Level Summary

- [ ] **Current Stack:** Next.js on Vercel, Drizzle ORM with a Supabase Postgres database, and Supabase for Authentication.
- [ ] **Target Stack:** Next.js on Cloudflare Pages, Drizzle ORM with a Cloudflare D1 database, and WorkOS for Authentication.

This is a significant architectural change that will enhance performance, potentially reduce costs, and modernize the stack. The migration will be conducted in **four phases** to minimize risk and ensure data integrity.

### **⚠️ Critical Security & Compatibility Considerations**
- User ID migration strategy required (Supabase → WorkOS)
- Mobile app (`apps/mobile/`) WorkOS integration needed
- WHOOP OAuth/webhook token migration
- Rate limiting migration from database to Cloudflare KV
- PWA offline capabilities preservation
- PostHog analytics migration for Workers environment

## 2. Phased Migration Approach

## 3. Cloudflare Setup

This section provides instructions for setting up the Cloudflare Pages and D1 environment.

### **Step 1: Create a Cloudflare Pages Project**
- [ ] Navigate to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
- [ ] In the sidebar, go to **Workers & Pages**.
- [ ] Click **Create application** and select the **Pages** tab.
- [ ] Click **Connect to Git** and select your GitHub repository.

### **Step 2: Configure Build Settings**
- [ ] For the **Build command**, enter `bun run build`.
- [ ] For the **Build output directory**, enter `.next`.
- [ ] Under **Environment variables**, add the necessary variables for your application (e.g., `WORKOS_API_KEY`, `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`).

### **Step 3: Create a D1 Database**
- [ ] In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **D1**.
- [ ] Click **Create database**.
- [ ] Give your database a name (e.g., `swole-tracker-prod`) and click **Create**.

### **Step 4: Bind D1 to your Pages Project**
- [ ] In your Pages project settings, go to **Functions** > **D1 database bindings**.
- [ ] Click **Add binding**.
- [ ] For **Variable name**, enter `DB`.
- [ ] For **D1 Database**, select the database you created in the previous step.
- [ ] Click **Save**.

## 4. Phase 1: Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

This phase focuses on getting a development version of the application running on your local machine with the new stack.

### **Security & Pre-migration Audit**

- [ ] An audit was performed on all tRPC routers (`src/server/api/routers/`) to assess the current application-layer security model.

**Conclusion: The existing codebase is robust.** There are no apparent security gaps. Data access is consistently and correctly isolated to the authenticated user across the entire application. This is excellent news, as it means the migration will focus on replacing infrastructure while preserving an already-secure logic pattern.

### **Step 1: Initial Setup & Branching**

- [ ] **Create a New Branch:** All work should be done on a dedicated git branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/cloudflare-migration
    ```
- [ ] **Install Cloudflare Wrangler:** This is the CLI for managing Cloudflare Workers and D1.
    ```bash
    npm install -g wrangler
    ```
- [ ] **Create Accounts:**
    - [ ] Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up).
    - [ ] Sign up for a [WorkOS account](https://dashboard.workos.com/signup).

### **Step 2: Database Migration (Postgres -> D1)**

- [ ] **Create a Local D1 Database:**
    - [ ] Use Wrangler to create a local D1 database for development.
    ```bash
    wrangler d1 database create swole-tracker-dev
    ```
    - [ ] This command will output the database name, and configuration details. Add these details to a new, local-only `.dev.vars` file in your project root. **Do not commit this file.**
    ```ini
    # .dev.vars
    [[d1_databases]]
    binding = "DB" # This is the binding name your worker will use
    database_name = "swole-tracker-dev"
    database_id = "your-database-id-from-wrangler"
    preview_database_id = "your-preview-id"
    ```

- [ ] **Update Drizzle Configuration:**
    - [ ] **Install D1 Driver:** Drizzle needs a different driver for D1.
        ```bash
        bun add drizzle-orm-d1
        ```
    - [ ] **Modify `drizzle.config.ts`:** Change the configuration to target SQLite/D1.
        - **OLD (`drizzle.config.ts`):**
            ```typescript
            export default {
              schema: "./src/server/db/schema.ts",
              dialect: "postgresql",
              dbCredentials: {
                url: databaseUrl,
              },
              tablesFilter: ["swole-tracker_*"],
            } satisfies Config;
            ```
        - **NEW (`drizzle.config.ts`):**
            ```typescript
            export default {
              schema: "./src/server/db/schema.ts",
              dialect: "sqlite", // Change dialect to sqlite
              driver: "d1", // Specify the d1 driver
              dbCredentials: {
                wranglerConfigPath: "wrangler.toml",
                dbName: "swole-tracker-dev",
              },
              tablesFilter: ["swole-tracker_*"],
            } satisfies Config;
            ```
    - [ ] **Update `wrangler.toml`:** Create or update `wrangler.toml` to include the D1 binding.
        ```toml
        # wrangler.toml
        name = "swole-tracker"
        compatibility_date = "2024-03-20"
        
        # Production Environment
        [env.production]
        
        [[env.production.d1_databases]]
        binding = "DB"
        database_name = "swole-tracker-prod"
        database_id = "production-database-id"
        
        [[env.production.kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "RATE_LIMIT_KV"
        id = "rate-limit-production-id"
        
        [[env.production.kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "CACHE_KV"
        id = "cache-production-id"
        
        # Staging Environment
        [env.staging]
        
        [[env.staging.d1_databases]]
        binding = "DB"
        database_name = "swole-tracker-staging"
        database_id = "staging-database-id"
        
        [[env.staging.kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "RATE_LIMIT_KV"
        id = "rate-limit-staging-id"
        
        [[env.staging.kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "CACHE_KV"
        id = "cache-staging-id"
        
        # Development (local)
        [[d1_databases]]
        binding = "DB"
        database_name = "swole-tracker-dev"
        database_id = "your-database-id-from-wrangler"
        
        [[kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "RATE_LIMIT_KV"
        id = "rate-limit-dev-id"
        
        [[kv_namespaces]]
        binding = "CACHE_KV"
        id = "cache-dev-id"
        
        # Environment Variables
        [vars]
        WORKOS_CLIENT_ID = "client_..."
        # Note: Sensitive variables like WORKOS_API_KEY should be set via dashboard
        ```

- [ ] **Adapt Drizzle Schema (`src/server/db/schema.ts`):**
    - [ ] **Change Table Creator:** Replace `pgTableCreator` with a generic `tableCreator` or one suitable for SQLite.
        - Change `import { pgTableCreator } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";` to `import { tableCreator } from "drizzle-orm";`
        - Change `pgTableCreator` to `tableCreator`.
    - [ ] **Detailed Data Type Mapping:** Replace Postgres-specific types with their SQLite equivalents.

| Postgres Type | SQLite/D1 Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d.timestamp({ withTimezone: true })` | `d.text()` or `d.integer()` | Storing as ISO strings in `d.text()` is often simpler. |
| `d.json()` | `d.text()` | JSON objects will be stored as strings. |
| `d.numeric(...)` | `d.real()` | For floating-point numbers. |
| `d.smallint()` | `d.integer()` | |
| `d.varchar({ length: ... })` | `d.text()` | SQLite does not enforce length on `VARCHAR`. |
| `d.date()` | `d.text()` | Store in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. |
| `d.boolean()` | `d.integer()` | Store as 0 for false and 1 for true. |

    - [ ] **Update Default Values:**
        - `default(sql
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)` -> `default(sql
(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
)`
    - [ ] **Update Auto-Incrementing Keys:**
        - `generatedByDefaultAsIdentity()` is a pg-specific feature. For SQLite, `d.integer().primaryKey({ autoIncrement: true })` is the standard.
    - [ ] **Constraint and Index Verification:** D1's support for foreign keys is relatively new. It is critical to test all constraints and indexes after the migration.
        - **Foreign Keys:** Verify that all foreign key constraints are created correctly in D1. Pay close attention to `onDelete: "cascade"` and `onDelete: "set null"` behavior.
        - **Unique Constraints:** Ensure that all `unique()` and `uniqueIndex()` constraints are correctly implemented and enforced in D1.
        - **Indexes:** Verify that all indexes are created correctly and that their performance is adequate for the application's query patterns.

- [ ] **Generate New Migrations:**
    - [ ] Once the schema file is updated, generate a new set of migrations for D1.
    ```bash
    bun drizzle-kit generate
    ```
    - [ ] Apply the new migration to your local D1 database.
    ```bash
    wrangler d1 migrations apply swole-tracker-dev --local
    ```

### **Step 3: Authentication Migration (Supabase -> WorkOS)**

- [ ] **Setup WorkOS:**
    - [ ] In your WorkOS dashboard, create a new project.
    - [ ] Navigate to "API Keys" and get your **Client ID** and **API Key**.
    - [ ] Navigate to "Redirects" and add `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` as an allowed redirect URI for development.

- [ ] **Install WorkOS SDK:**
    ```bash
    bun add @workos-inc/node
    ```

- [ ] **Update Environment Variables:**
    - [ ] Add your WorkOS credentials to your `.env` files (and `.env.example`).
    ```env
    # .env.example
    WORKOS_API_KEY=your_workos_api_key
    WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=your_workos_client_id
    ```

- [ ] **Replace Auth Logic:**
    - [ ] **Create a WorkOS Helper:** Create a new file, e.g., `src/lib/workos.ts`, to initialize the WorkOS client.
    - [ ] **Update Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`):** This is the most critical change.
        - Remove the Supabase SSR client (`createServerClient`).
        - Use the WorkOS SDK to get the authenticated user from the `workos-session` cookie. The WorkOS SDK provides helpers for this. If the user is not authenticated, redirect to a new login page.
    - [ ] **Replace Client-Side Supabase Calls:**
        - Go through every file that uses `createBrowserSupabaseClient` (e.g., `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx`, `src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`, `src/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`).
        - Replace all calls to `supabase.auth.signInWith...`, `supabase.auth.signUp`, and `supabase.auth.signOut` with their WorkOS equivalents. You will likely need to create new API routes (e.g., `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/logout`) that use the WorkOS Node SDK to perform these actions securely on the server.
    - [ ] **Update Server-Side Auth:**
        - Modify the tRPC context (`src/server/api/trpc.ts`) to get the user from your new WorkOS-powered middleware instead of from `createServerSupabaseClient`.

- [ ] **Update Test Suite:**
    - [ ] The existing test suite heavily mocks Supabase for authentication and database interactions.
    - [ ] Update all relevant tests in `src/__tests__/` to mock the new WorkOS authentication flow and D1 database interactions.
    - [ ] This includes updating mocks for `createBrowserSupabaseClient` and `createServerClient` to mock the new WorkOS client and tRPC context.

### **Step 4: Running the App Locally**

- [ ] Use Wrangler to run your Next.js application in a local environment that simulates the Cloudflare Workers runtime.
    ```bash
    wrangler pages dev .next
    ```

This command starts a local server. You can now access your application at `http://localhost:8788` (or a similar port) and test the new database connection and authentication flow.
