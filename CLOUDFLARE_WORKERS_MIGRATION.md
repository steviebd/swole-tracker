# Cloudflare Workers Migration - Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated from Cloudflare Pages to Cloudflare Workers deployment. The application now uses proper Workers configuration instead of Pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated wrangler.toml Configuration
- Removed `[build]` and `[assets]` sections that were specific to Pages
- Kept the correct `main` entry point for the Worker script
- Maintained D1 database bindings and KV namespace configurations
- Updated both `wrangler.toml` and `wrangler.toml.template`

### 2. Updated package.json Scripts
- Modified deployment scripts to use proper environment flags
- Added `--env=""` to target the default environment explicitly
- Added new `deploy:versions` commands for versioned deployments

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md Documentation
- Added new deployment commands section
- Documented the `build:cloudflare` command
- Listed all available deployment options (dev, staging, production)

## Deployment Commands

### Build Commands
- `bun run build:cloudflare` - Build the Next.js app for Cloudflare Workers
- `bun run generate:wrangler` - Generate wrangler.toml from template

### Deployment Commands
- `bun run deploy` - Deploy to development environment
- `bun run deploy:staging` - Deploy to staging environment  
- `bun run deploy:production` - Deploy to production environment

### Version Upload Commands (Alternative to direct deploy)
- `bun run deploy:versions` - Upload version to development
- `bun run deploy:versions:staging` - Upload version to staging
- `bun run deploy:versions:production` - Upload version to production

## Build Process

The build process uses:
1. **npm** (not bun) for the build:cloudflare script - this is correct
2. `npx tsx scripts/generate-wrangler-config.ts` to generate wrangler.toml from environment variables
3. `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` to convert Next.js output to Workers format
4. Wrangler to deploy the resulting Worker

### Environment Variable Substitution

The `build:cloudflare` command now includes `generate:wrangler:npm` which will:
- Read your `wrangler.toml.template`
- Substitute `${VARIABLE_NAME}` placeholders with actual environment values
- Generate the final `wrangler.toml`

This ensures your D1 database IDs and KV namespace IDs are correctly populated in Cloudflare's build environment.

## Verification

✅ Build process works correctly  
✅ Wrangler dry-run succeeds  
✅ D1 database bindings configured properly  
✅ KV namespace bindings configured properly  
✅ Environment variable configuration working  

## Final Resolution - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue Fixed:** Environment variable substitution in wrangler.toml generation

**Problem:** The `generateTomlFromConfig()` function was outputting literal template string placeholders (e.g., `${CLOUDFLARE_PROD_D1_DATABASE_ID}`) instead of the actual resolved environment variable values.

**Solution:** Updated the template literal in `scripts/generate-wrangler-config.ts:146-229` to properly interpolate the values from the config object instead of outputting placeholder strings.

**Verification Results:**
✅ Build process works correctly  
✅ Wrangler dry-run succeeds for all environments (dev, staging, production)
✅ D1 database bindings configured with real IDs  
✅ KV namespace bindings configured with real IDs  
✅ Environment variable substitution working properly  
✅ Universal npm/bun compatibility maintained

**Ready for Production:** The deployment process is now fully functional and ready for production use.

## Important Notes

- Use `npm run build:cloudflare` (not `bun run`) when deploying via CI/CD - this is the correct approach
- The build command now includes wrangler.toml generation from environment variables 
- The original error was due to trying to upload static assets as a Worker, which has been resolved
- All D1 database and KV bindings are preserved and working correctly

## Universal Build Command - Final Solution

**Both `bun run build:cloudflare` and `npm run build:cloudflare` now work identically!**

The unified command chain is:
```bash
build:cloudflare
↓
node scripts/build-tokens.js && node scripts/build-mobile-tokens.js && npx tsx scripts/generate-wrangler-config.ts && next build && npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

**What this means:**
✅ Works with `npm run build:cloudflare` locally  
✅ Works with `bun run build:cloudflare` locally  
✅ Works with `npm run build:cloudflare` on Cloudflare  
✅ Uses direct Node.js commands (no package manager dependencies)  
✅ Generates `wrangler.toml` from environment variables every time  

**Build Process:**
1. Build design tokens (Node.js directly)
2. Build mobile design tokens (Node.js directly)  
3. **Generate wrangler.toml from template using environment variables** ✅
4. Build Next.js app 
5. Convert to Workers format

Your Cloudflare environment variables (like `CLOUDFLARE_PROD_D1_DATABASE_ID`) will be properly substituted into the `wrangler.toml` during the build process regardless of which package manager is used.
