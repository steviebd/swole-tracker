Update strength workout tracker to incorporate
    - Body weight as an option
    - Add an option to do for one excerise, register different weights for different sets. Rethink total sets and the UX.
    - Keep pulling historic history that maps to the current workout but give peopel the flexbility to drop a set if needed

Incorporate AI to do reccomendations of workouts by using Whoop data to:
    - Recommend workouts based on user's fitness level and goals
    - Provide personalized workout plans based on user's fitness data
    - Offer suggestions for modifications to workouts based on user's progress and feedback
# From o3
Here’s a roadmap for “wrapping” AI around your Whoop-powered strength-training app. The basic flow is:

1. Ingest & Filter  
   • Pull “workout” objects from Whoop’s API.  
   • Only keep workouts whose `type` (or `name`) maps to strength/weight training.  

2. Augment with Whoop Biometrics  
   For each workout, fetch the user’s concomitant recovery data (HRV, sleep performance, readiness, strain) from Whoop’s User Metrics endpoints for the same day.  

3. Feature Engineering  
   Build per‐workout feature vectors, e.g.:  
   • volume = ∑(sets × reps × weight)  
   • avg_heart_rate, max_heart_rate, time_in_zones  
   • recovery_score, sleep_perf, HRV, daily_strain  
   • historical deltas (e.g. % change vs. last 4 workouts)  

4. AI-Driven Use-Cases  
   A. Dynamic Workout Adjustment  
     – Given today’s readiness, propose a template tweak (e.g. drop volume by 10%, swap in unilateral work).  
     – Prompt example for GPT:  
       ```text
       “User’s 4‐wk avg volume: 12 000 kg. Today’s recovery: 48/100.  
       Suggest a strength workout template (~4 sets/exercise) to optimize growth while respecting low recovery.”  
       ```  
   B. Performance Trend Analysis  
     – Use simple ML (e.g. linear regression) or GPT to summarize:  
       “Your squat 1RM est. has risen 5 kg (+3%) over last 6 weeks. Your recovery on squat days averages 65 vs. non-squat days 55—good sign!”  
   C. Overtraining/Risk Alerts  
     – Classification model (e.g. decision tree) or rule‐based on high strain + low recovery for >3 days → “Consider a deload or active-recovery session.”  
   D. Template Recommendation & Variation  
     – Fine-tune a small GPT‐3.5/GPT-4 prompt to generate new exercises or periodization blocks based on user’s goals and Whoop metrics.  

5. Architecture Sketch  
   • Supabase stores raw Whoop workouts + biometrics.  
   • A Node.js “AI service” periodically:  
     a) Queries new Whoop workouts + daily metrics  
     b) Runs feature‐pipeline  
     c) Calls OpenAI’s Chat or Completion API for insights/recs  
     d) Persists AI outputs back to Supabase (e.g. `recommended_workout`, `insights`)  
   • Front-end fetches these alongside user‐logged workouts.  

6. Sample Node.js Snippet (fetch → prompt → store)  
   ```js
   import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
   import OpenAI from 'openai';

   const supabase = createClient(process.env.SB_URL, 
                                   process.env.SB_KEY);
   const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY });

   async function generateRecommendation(userId, date) {
     // 1) Load workouts + metrics
     const { data: workouts } = await supabase
       .from('whoop_workouts')
       .select('*')
       .eq('user_id', userId)
       .eq('date', date)
       .eq('type', 'strength');
     const { data: metrics } = await supabase
       .from('whoop_metrics')
       .select('*')
       .eq('user_id', userId)
       .eq('date', date);

     // 2) Build prompt
     const volume = workouts.reduce((sum, w) => 
       sum + w.sets * w.reps * (w.weight || 0), 0);
     const prompt = `
     User strength volume today: ${volume} kg.
     Recovery: ${metrics.recovery_score}/100,
     Sleep Performance: ${metrics.sleep_perf}/100,
     HRV: ${metrics.hrv} ms.
     Suggest a 4-ex exercise strength session at moderate intensity.
     `;

     // 3) Call AI
     const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
       model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
       messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
     });

     // 4) Store reco
     await supabase.from('ai_recommendations').insert({
       user_id: userId,
       date,
       rec: completion.choices[0].message.content
     });
   }
   ```

7. Next Steps  
   • Decide which “AI value-add” you want first (e.g. auto-generated templates vs. overtraining alerts).  
   • Build your feature pipeline & store a history.  
   • Prototype a GPT prompt or a small regression/classifier.  
   • Iterate on UX—show recommendations in your app alongside logged sets/reps/weights.  

With this in place, your app will not only log strength workouts but also coach users in real time based on both their performance and Whoop’s recovery and strain data.

Below is the list of WHOOP API endpoints (and key fields) you’ll need to pull in order to implement the AI-driven recommendations I described:


1. 
Workout Data
• Endpoint: GET /user/workouts
– Scope: read:workout
– Query params: start, end (ISO timestamps)
– Key fields per record:
• id, start, end, sport_name (to filter “strength” workouts)
• score.strain
• score.average_heart_rate, score.max_heart_rate
• score.kilojoule
• score.zone_durations (time in HR zones)



2. 
Physiological Cycles (Daily Strain)
• Endpoint: GET /user/cycles
– Scope: read:cycles
– Query params: start, end
– Key fields per cycle:
• id, start, end
• score.strain (24 h strain)



3. 
Recovery Data
• Endpoint: GET /recovery/{cycleId}
– Scope: read:recovery
– Path param: cycleId
– Key fields in .score:
• recovery_score
• resting_heart_rate
• hrv_rmssd_milli
• spo2_percentage
• skin_temp_celsius



4. 
Sleep Data
• Endpoint: GET /sleep/{sleepId}  or  GET /user/sleep?start&end
– Scope: read:sleep
– Key fields in .score:
• sleep_performance_percentage
• sleep_consistency_percentage
• sleep_efficiency_percentage
• stage_summary.total_light_sleep_time_milli
• stage_summary.total_slow_wave_sleep_time_milli
• stage_summary.total_rem_sleep_time_milli



5. 
Body Measurements
• Endpoint: GET /user/body_measurements
– Scope: read:body_measurement
– Key fields:
• weight_kilogram
• height_meter
• max_heart_rate



6. 
User Profile (to tie data to your users)
• Endpoint: GET /user/profile
– Scope: read:profile
– Key fields:
• user_id, first_name, last_name, email



Summary of required OAuth scopes:
– read:workout
– read:cycles
– read:recovery
– read:sleep
– read:body_measurement
– read:profile

With these pulls you can:
– compute per-workout feature vectors (volume, strain, HR zones)
– track daily strain (cycles)
– assess readiness (recovery & sleep metrics)
– anchor workouts to user’s body stats (weight, max HR)

Once fetched and stored in your database you can feed them into your AI pipeline to generate dynamic workout adjustments, trend analyses, and overtraining alerts.
