# TODO: Enhanced Workout Intelligence Implementation Plan

## Overview
Enhance the existing "Get Workout Intelligence" feature to provide dynamic, template-specific exercise recommendations with historical data analysis and direct workout integration.

## Current State Analysis
-  Health advice API endpoint and database schema in place
-  Accept/Override UI components functional
-  Historical data tracking via `sessionExercises` table
-  Readiness calculations from WHOOP/subjective wellness
- L Recommendations are static (3 exercises) instead of template-dynamic
- L Accept functionality doesn't pre-populate workout sets
- L Historical analysis limited to basic calculations

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Environment Variable Verification
- [ ] Verify `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL_HEALTH` is properly used (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Update environment configuration if needed

### 2. Template-Specific Exercise Matching
**File**: `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/api/health-advice/route.ts`
- [ ] Modify health advice API to fetch current template exercises
- [ ] Query `templateExercises` table for current workout template
- [ ] Ensure recommendations match ONLY exercises in current template
- [ ] Remove static exercise array, make it dynamic based on template

### 3. Historical Data Analysis Enhancement
**File**: `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/lib/health-calculations.ts`
- [ ] Create function to fetch last 2 workout sessions for each exercise (across any workout, regardless of template)
- [ ] Implement trend analysis for weight/rep progression
- [ ] Add per-session preference selection for weight vs rep progression (UI choice within active workout session)
- [ ] Factor in readiness level for progression recommendations
- [ ] Calculate optimal rest periods based on exercise type and user readiness


### 54. Database Query Updates
**Files**: 
- `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/server/api/routers/progress.ts`
- `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/api/health-advice/route.ts`
- [ ] Create query to fetch last 2 sessions of specific exercises (across all workouts)
- [ ] Add template exercise fetching from active workout session to health advice endpoint
- [ ] Optimize queries for performance with proper indexing

### 5. UI Component Updates
**File**: `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/_components/health-advice/SetSuggestions.tsx`
- [ ] Make exercise recommendations dynamic (not fixed at 3) - Now shows all exercises from template
- [ ] Exercise reccommendations should be based on the current workout session that the user has selected and based on the exercises and sets that the user has chosen to do
- [ ] The prompt should 
- [ ] Add loading states for apply functionality
- [ ] Show success/error feedback for accepted recommendations
- [ ] Add per-session weight vs rep progression selection UI (user choice before generating recommendations)
- [ ] Add rest period suggestions to UI
- [ ] Show trend indicators (increasing/maintaining/decreasing)

### 6. Accept Functionality Integration
**Files**:
- `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/_components/health-advice/SetSuggestions.tsx`
- `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/server/api/routers/workouts.ts` (if exists)
- [ ] Create tRPC endpoint to update workout session with accepted suggestions
- [ ] Modify accept button to alter existing set values (weight/reps) for those exercises based on progression/overload choice
- [ ] Add loading states during set updates
- [ ] Show success/error feedback for accepted recommendations

### 7. Data Flow Updates
**File**: `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/_components/WorkoutSessionWithHealthAdvice.tsx`
- [ ] Pass current workout session ID to health advice API (template ID derived from active session)
- [ ] Update state management to handle dynamic exercise count
- [ ] Refresh workout session data after accepting suggestions

### 8. AI Prompt Enhancement
**File**: `/Users/steven/swole-tracker/src/app/api/health-advice/route.ts`
- [ ] Update AI prompt to include exercise-specific historical trends 
- [ ] Prompt should refelect the exercise and set for that particular exercise in the workout session id
- [ ] Add context about user's selected progression strategy (weight vs reps)
- [ ] Include rest period optimization in prompt
- [ ] Provide template exercise list to AI for focused recommendations
= [ ] Update error handling if the prompt returns null etc given the variable of the exercise.

### 9. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test with templates containing 1, 3, 5+ exercises - Handled via dynamic template exercise fetching
- [ ] Verify historical data accuracy for trend analysis - Implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Test accept functionality across different exercise types - Robust error handling added
- [ ] Validate rest period calculations with different readiness levels - Edge cases covered with fallbacks

### 10. Critical Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle exercises with insufficient data (< 2 previous sessions) - provide conservative defaults
- [ ] Validate active workout session exists before processing
- [ ] Fallback logic when AI service is unavailable - show cached or basic recommendations
- [ ] Handle malformed or missing progression preference selection
- [ ] Prevent concurrent updates to same workout session sets

## Technical Details

### Key Database Tables
- `workoutTemplates` - Template structure
- `templateExercises` - Exercises per template
- `sessionExercises` - Historical performance data
- `healthAdvice` - AI recommendations storage

### API Endpoints to Modify/Create
- `POST /api/health-advice` - Enhanced with session-specific logic (derive template from session ID)
- `POST /api/trpc/workouts.updateSessionSets` - New endpoint for accepting suggestions and updating set values

### Environment Variables
- `AI_GATEWAY_MODEL_HEALTH` - Verify not hardcoded
- Existing: `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `AI_GATEWAY_PROMPT_HEALTH`

### Success Criteria
1. Recommendations show ALL exercises from current template (dynamic count, derived from active session)
2. AI analyzes last 2 sessions of each exercise (regardless of template) for trend-based suggestions
3. Accept button alters existing workout set values with suggested weight/reps based on progression choice
4. Rest period suggestions based on readiness and exercise type
5. Per-session weight vs rep progression strategy selection
6. No hardcoded values, all driven by active session template and historical data
