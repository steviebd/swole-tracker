Phase 1: 

Progress/ changes

1. Recent Personal Records - Make the display bigger so it displays up to 3 personal records at a time. Make sure that it's sorted by date from latest.
2. Charts should go from left to right for weight and timeline. Check to see if this is correct as it seems like it's from right to left. 
3. Remove ðŸš§ WHOOP Integration coming in a future update. This is a preview of planned features.
4. Remove Achievement Badges feature

Phase 2:

Look at /workout/session/id and look at refactoring the following:

1. In Today's Workout Intelligence - Exercise Recommendations - The reccommendations should display the exercises that are relevant for this workout. Right now it's displaying all exercises.
2. Remove progression suggestion pop-up on the main page
3. Progression suggestion should be a button after "Exercise Recommendations" that you click.
4. Functionality should be the same, where it pops up a modal with the progression suggestion when clicked.
5. Look at the progression suggestion as right now when you select Add 2.5kg or Add 1 rep to all sets, it only adds it to the largest set but not all sets. 
6. When you look at it, write down the steps to fix it to PROGRESSION_FIX.MD only.
