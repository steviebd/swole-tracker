# View Progress Feature - Implementation Plan

## üìã Overview
Transform the View Progress card from basic workout history to a comprehensive progress dashboard focused on strength gains, volume tracking, and consistency metrics.

## üéØ Priority Order
1. **Strength Gains** (Top Sets) - Most Important
2. **Volume Tracking** - Secondary 
3. **Consistency** - Third
4. **Recent Achievements/PRs** - Motivational
5. **WHOOP Integration** - Placeholder for future

- [x] Add volume drill-down modal

### Phase 5: Consistency Section ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `ConsistencySection.tsx` component  
- [x] Build workout frequency calendar visualization
- [x] Implement streak tracking (current + longest streak)
- [x] Add 3x/week target tracking with progress indicators
- [x] Create consistency score calculations
- [x] Build consistency trends over time

### Phase 6: Personal Records System ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `PersonalRecordsSection.tsx` component
- [x] Implement PR detection logic (weight + volume PRs)
- [x] Build recent achievements timeline
- [x] Add PR milestone celebrations/notifications
- [x] Create PR history tracking

### Phase 7: Recent Achievements Dashboard ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `RecentAchievements.tsx` summary component
- [x] Build "This Month's Progress" summary cards
- [x] Add recent PRs highlight section  
- [x] Implement motivational progress indicators
- [x] Create achievement badges/icons

### Phase 8: WHOOP Integration Placeholder ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `WhoopIntegrationSection.tsx` placeholder component
- [x] Add recovery score overlay mockup
- [x] Implement heart rate zones placeholder
- [x] Create performance correlation placeholder charts
- [x] Add integration status indicator

### Phase 9: Drill-Down Modals ‚úÖ
- [x] Create `StrengthAnalysisModal.tsx` for detailed strength metrics
- [x] Build `VolumeAnalysisModal.tsx` for deep volume analysis  
- [x] Implement `ConsistencyAnalysisModal.tsx` for consistency details
- [x] Add `PRHistoryModal.tsx` for full PR timeline
- [x] Create modal state management and navigation

### Phase 10: Home Page Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Integrate `ProgressDashboard.tsx` logic with home page cards - "This Week", "Avg Duration" and "Weekly Goal" now use real data from progress API
- [x] Link Weekly Progress section to relevant `ProgressDashboard.tsx` sections with anchor navigation (#consistency, #volume)
- [x] Refactor "Bench Press Progression" to dynamic exercise selection in `ProgressionModal.tsx` with full ProgressDashboard integration

### Phase 11: UI/UX Polish & Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Add loading states for all progress sections (skeletons, spinners, placeholders)
- [x] Implement error handling and empty states (no data states, fallbacks)
- [x] Add responsive design for mobile/tablet (breakpoints, mobile-first layouts)
- [x] Create smooth transitions and animations (consistent duration-300 classes)
- [x] Polish progress sections and fix edge cases
- [x] Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard navigation)

## üîß Technical Notes

### Data Structure Utilization
- Leverage `sessionExercises` table for workout data
- Use `exerciseLinks` and `masterExercises` for exercise consolidation
- Utilize `workoutSessions` for consistency tracking
- Access `userPreferences.min_days_per_week` for consistency targets

### Existing Chart Infrastructure
- Extend `WeightProgressChart.tsx` for strength progression
- Reuse `OneRMProgressChart.tsx` for 1RM estimations  
- Build new volume charts using `BaseChart` component
- Follow existing chart validation and sanitization patterns

### Time Range Implementation
- Default to monthly view
- Support weekly/yearly toggles
- Implement comparative analysis (current vs previous period)
- Handle timezone considerations for consistency tracking

### Performance Considerations
- Implement data pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed progress calculations
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching

## üé® Design Consistency
- Follow existing component patterns and styling
- Use consistent color schemes from chart config
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Apply existing theme system (light/dark modes)
- Follow accessibility standards
